DellUnit
========

DellUnit is a Dell-specific wrapper around Python's [unittest2](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/unittest2) library.

The best way to get started is to learn to use Python's unittests using the [documentation](http://docs.python.org/2/library/unittest.html).

From there you can take a look at the sample tests that are included in the framework in the **tests** directory.
